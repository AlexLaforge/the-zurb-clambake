- Retina Logo
- 100% Fluid Email with dual columns.
- No @media queries. 
- Zurb Responsive Email Template

Fluid layouts thrive on max-width and min-width. Unfortunately Outlook products do not support these features and creating pure fluid HTML email borderlines impossible. Outlook is not the only one with it's melon in the pig bucket. Per Campaign Monitor, the new Gmail 2.0 ignores styles in the head which rule out high-res @media queries. When it comes to HTML email newsletters, the farm is in disarray.
